## Features

- Wirelessly transmits heart and lung sounds to a remote device.
- Filters and processes audio signals to improve sound quality.
- Provides real-time audio visualization and recording.
- Can be used for telemedicine and remote patient monitoring.

## Hardware

The hardware components required for the DIY Wireless Digital Stethoscope project include:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Nano)
- Pulse Sensor - SEN-11574
- Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)
- Battery and power management components
- Audio output device (e.g., headphones or speakers)

## Software

The software for the project involves both the Arduino firmware and the mobile application. The Arduino firmware reads audio data from the microphone sensor, processes it, and transmits it via Bluetooth to the mobile app.

The mobile application receives the audio data and visualizes it in real-time, allowing users to listen to and record heart and lung sounds. The application can be developed for Android and iOS platforms.

## Assembly

The assembly of the DIY Wireless Digital Stethoscope involves connecting the hardware components, uploading the firmware to the Arduino, and building the mobile application.

1. Connect the Pulse Sensor - SEN-11574 and Bluetooth module to the Arduino board.
2. Upload the Arduino firmware to the board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Build the mobile application using a suitable framework (e.g., Flutter, React Native).
4. Pair the Bluetooth module with the mobile device and launch the app.

## Usage

Once assembled and set up, the DIY Wireless Digital Stethoscope can be used for various purposes, including:
- Listening to heart and lung sounds in real-time.
- Recording audio for later analysis and diagnosis.
- Transmitting audio to remote medical professionals for consultation.
